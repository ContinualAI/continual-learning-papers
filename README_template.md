## Add a new paper
The list of papers is maintained through a Zotero group. You can join the group and help us keeping it updated (see next section).  

If you don't want to join the group, you can simply open a Github issue to suggest us a new paper (or even more than one). We will take care of adding it to the list as soon as possible. 

1. Open a new Github issue.

2. Attach your bib file containing the paper you want to include in the list. If you don't have a bib file, just provide us with the link to the paper. The link should point to a location where paper metadata can be appropriately retrieved by common reference managers.

Alternatively, you can submit a Pull Request with a modification to the bibtex files directly!

## Join the ContinualAI Zotero group

You can give your contribution to the group by **adding new papers** or by helping **annotating the existing ones**.

1. Join our [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2623909/continual_learning_papers/)

2. To **add a new paper**

	2.1. Add it to the group folder which best represents the paper contribution. Read some advices below if you are uncertain on this. You can add the paper from your library or directly from the paper webpage through the Zotero web browser plugin. 
    
    2.2 Make sure that at least `title`, `authors`, `item type` and `publication` are specified. The `year` must be put inside `date` field.
    
    2.3 Also put a link to the paper in the `url` field. 

3. To **annotate** an existing paper

	3.1. Check the list of existing tags in `tags.csv` file. If you want to add a new tag, please add it in there and submit a Pull Request.

	3.2. Add your tags in the `Tags` tab of Zotero. Please, remember to write the tag in square brackets e.g. `[mytag]`

	3.3. Add your notes in the `Notes` tab of Zotero.

We will periodically export the bibtex to keep the list updated. In case we forgot, join the [ContinualAI Slack](https://continualai.herokuapp.com/) and complain about our behavior in the `#wiki` channel.

### Advices to add new papers in Zotero

* Check if the paper already exist by using the `Citation Key` or the title in Zotero search bar.

* Don't forget to add the publication venue (Journal, Proceedings...). Use `publication = arXiv` if the paper is a preprint.

* We use a system based on categories. This can sometimes be limiting. In general, please consider to add the paper in the category which you consider the most relevant one. You can add the paper in at most **2** categories, if you believe that both are equally relevant.

* Please, do not add new tags if a similar category already exists.
