  abstract = {Neural Networks trained with gradient descent are known to be susceptible to catastrophic forgetting caused by parameter shift during the training process. In the context of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) this results in poor performance on heterogeneous datasets and on sub-tasks like rare phrase translation. On the other hand, non-parametric approaches are immune to forgetting, perfectly complementing the generalization ability of NMT. However, attempts to combine non-parametric or retrieval based approaches with NMT have only been successful on narrow domains, possibly due to over-reliance on sentence level retrieval. We propose a novel n-gram level retrieval approach that relies on local phrase level similarities, allowing us to retrieve neighbors that are useful for translation even when overall sentence similarity is low. We complement this with an expressive neural network, allowing our model to extract information from the noisy retrieved context. We evaluate our semi-parametric NMT approach on a heterogeneous dataset composed of WMT, IWSLT, JRC-Acquis and OpenSubtitles, and demonstrate gains on all 4 evaluation sets. The semi-parametric nature of our approach opens the door for non-parametric domain adaptation, demonstrating strong inference-time adaptation performance on new domains without the need for any parameter updates.},

We consider the practical scenario where a high capacity server interacts with a myriad of resource-limited edge devices, imposing strong requirements on scalability and local data privacy. We aim to address this challenge within the continual learning paradigm and provide a novel Dual User-Adaptation framework (DUA) to explore the problem. This framework flexibly disentangles user-adaptation into model personalization on the server and local data regularization on the user device, with desirable properties regarding scalability and privacy constraints. First, on the server, we introduce incremental learning of task-specific expert models, subsequently aggregated using a concealed unsupervised user prior. Aggregation avoids retraining, whereas the user prior conceals sensitive raw user data, and grants unsupervised adaptation. Second, local user-adaptation incorporates a domain adaptation point of view, adapting regularizing batch normalization parameters to the user data. We explore various empirical user configurations with different priors in categories and a tenfold of transforms for MIT Indoor Scene recognition, and classify numbers in a combined MNIST and SVHN setup. Extensive experiments yield promising results for data-driven local adaptation and elicit user priors for server adaptation to depend on the model rather than user data. Hence, although user-adaptation remains a challenging open problem, the DUA framework formalizes a principled foundation for personalizing both on server and user device, while maintaining privacy and scalability.},

The proposed method is effective without accessing to the old dataset to address the issues of high training cost and old dataset unavailability. To achieve this, knowledge distillation is applied as a guidance to retain the recognition ability from the previous model, which is then combined with the new ASR task for model optimization. With an ASR model pre-trained on 12,000h Mandarin speech, we test our proposed method on 300h new scenario task and 1h new named entities task. Experiments show that our method yields 3.25\% and 0.88\% absolute Character Error Rate (CER) reduction on the new scenario, when compared with the pre-trained model and the full-data retraining baseline, respectively. It even yields a surprising 0.37\% absolute CER reduction on the new scenario than the fine-tuning. For the new named entities task, our method significantly improves the accuracy compared with the pre-trained model, i.e. 16.95\% absolute CER reduction. For both of the new task adaptions, the new models still maintain a same accuracy with the baseline on the old tasks.},

  abstract = {Lifelong learning has recently attracted attention in building machine learning systems that continually accumulate and transfer knowledge to help future learning. Unsupervised topic modeling has been popularly used to discover topics from document collections. However, the application of topic modeling is challenging due to data sparsity, e.g., in a small collection of (short) documents and thus, generate incoherent topics and sub-optimal document representations. To address the problem, we propose a lifelong learning framework for neural topic modeling that can continuously process streams of document collections, accumulate topics and guide future topic modeling tasks by knowledge transfer from several sources to better deal with the sparse data. In the lifelong process, we particularly investigate jointly: (1) sharing generative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer prior knowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past learning via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic regularization approaches. Given a stream of document collections, we apply the proposed Lifelong Neural Topic Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three sparse document collections as future tasks and demonstrate improved performance quantified by perplexity, topic coherence and information retrieval task.},

To overcome this obstacle, we propose CLOPS, a healthcare-specific replay-based continual learning strategy. In three continual learning scenarios based on three publically-available datasets, we show that CLOPS can outperform its multi-task learning counterpart. Moreover, we propose end-to-end trainable parameters, which we term task-instance parameters, that can be used to quantify task difficulty and similarity. This quantification yields insights into both network interpretability and clinical applications, where task difficulty is poorly quantified.},

Specifically, we adopt a domain-independent neural conversational model and introduce a novel neural continual learning algorithm that allows a conversational agent to accumulate skills across different tasks in a data-efficient way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies continual learning to conversation systems. We verified the efficacy of our method through a conversational skill transfer from either synthetic dialogs or human-human dialogs to human-computer conversations in a customer support domain.},

Using the ChestX-ray14 and the MIMIC-CXR datasets, we demonstrate empirically that these methods provide promising options to improve the performance of Deep Learning models on a target domain and to mitigate effectively catastrophic forgetting for the source domain. To this end, the best overall performance was obtained using JT, while for LWF competitive results could be achieved - even without accessing data from the source domain.},

We test SDA on convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures.

We examine an alternative called Continual Learning (CL), a memory-augmented approach, which can provide transparent explanations, i.e. which memory did what and when. This work has implications for many financial applications including credit, time-varying fairness in decision making and more. We make three important new observations. Firstly, as well as being more explainable, time-series CL approaches outperform LSTMs as well as a simple sliding window learner using feed-forward neural networks (FFNN). Secondly, we show that CL based on a sliding window learner (FFNN) is more effective than CL based on a sequential learner (LSTM). Thirdly, we examine how real-world, time-series noise impacts several similarity approaches used in CL memory addressing. We provide these insights using an approach called Continual Learning Augmentation (CLA) tested on a complex real-world problem, emerging market equities investment decision making. CLA provides a test-bed as it can be based on different types of time-series learners, allowing testing of LSTM and FFNN learners side by side. CLA is also used to test several distance approaches used in a memory recall-gate: Euclidean distance (ED), dynamic time warping (DTW), auto-encoders (AE) and a novel hybrid approach, warp-AE. We find that ED under-performs DTW and AE but warp-AE shows the best overall performance in a real-world financial task.},

  abstract = {With the acceleration of urbanization and the increase in the number of motor vehicles, more and more social problems such as traffic congestion have emerged. Accordingly, efficient and accurate traffic flow prediction has become a research hot spot in the field of intelligent transportation. However, traditional machine learning algorithms cannot further optimize the model with the increase of the data scale, and the deep learning algorithms perform poorly in mobile application or real-time application; how to train and update deep learning models efficiently and accurately is still an urgent problem since they require huge computation resources and time costs. Therefore, an incremental learning-based CNN-LTSM model, IL-TFNet, is proposed for traffic flow prediction in this study. The lightweight convolution neural network-based model architecture is designed to process spatiotemporal and external environment features simultaneously to improve the prediction performance and prediction efficiency of the model. Especially, the K-means clustering algorithm is applied as an uncertainty feature to extract unknown traffic accident information. During the model training, instead of the traditional batch learning algorithm, the incremental learning algorithm is applied to reduce the cost of updating the model and satisfy the requirements of high real-time performance and low computational overhead in short-term traffic prediction. Furthermore, the idea of combining incremental learning with active learning is proposed to fine-tune the prediction model to improve prediction accuracy in special situations. Experiments have proved that compared with other traffic flow prediction models, the IL-TFNet model performs well in short-term traffic flow prediction.},

  abstract = {The development of visual sensing technologies has made it possible to obtain some high resolution and to gather many high-resolution satellite images. To make the best use of these images, it is essential to be able to recognize and retrieve their intrinsic scene information. The problem of scene recognition in remote sensing images has recently aroused considerable interest, mainly due to the great success achieved by deep learning methods in generic image classification. Nevertheless, such methods usually require large amounts of labeled data. By contrast, remote sensing images are relatively scarce and expensive to obtain. Moreover, data sets from different aerospace research institutions exhibit large disparities. In order to address these problems, we propose a model based on a meta-learning method with the ability of learning a classifier from just few-shot samples. With the proposed model, the knowledge learned from one data set can be easily adapted to a new data set, which, in turn, would serve in the lifelong few-shot learning. Scene-level image recognition experiments, on public high-resolution remote sensing image data sets, validate our proposed lifelong few-shot learning model.},
