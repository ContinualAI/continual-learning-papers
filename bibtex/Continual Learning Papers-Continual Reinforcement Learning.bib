  abstract = {A long-standing challenge in artificial intelligence is lifelong learning. In lifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must efficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic forgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However, they can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory issues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that continually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents a first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of policies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy can accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this method, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a value-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting the number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal performance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an 18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer are observed. Due to slow, monotonic improvement, PPO requires fewer policies, 1 policy for the 27-task domain and 4 policies for the 18-task domain, but it learns the tasks with lower accuracy than D(R)QN. These findings validate lifetime-scalable policy reuse and suggest using D(R)QN for larger and PPO for smaller library sizes.},

  abstract = {A key stepping stone in the development of an artificial general intelligence (a machine that can perform any task), is the production of agents that can perform multiple tasks at once instead of just one. Unfortunately, canonical methods are very prone to catastrophic forgetting (CF) - the act of overwriting previous knowledge about a task when learning a new task. Recent efforts have developed techniques for overcoming CF in learning systems, but no attempt has been made to apply these new techniques to evolutionary systems. This research presents a novel technique, weight protection, for reducing CF in evolutionary systems by adapting a method from learning systems. It is used in conjunction with other evolutionary approaches for overcoming CF and is shown to be effective at alleviating CF when applied to a suite of reinforcement learning tasks. It is speculated that this work could indicate the potential for a wider application of existing learning-based approaches to evolutionary systems and that evolutionary techniques may be competitive with or better than learning systems when it comes to reducing CF.},

We argue that previous experience with similar problems can provide an agent with information about how it should explore when facing a new but related problem. We show that the search for an optimal exploration strategy can be formulated as a reinforcement learning problem itself and demonstrate that such strategy can leverage patterns found in the structure of related problems. We conclude with experiments that show the benefits of optimizing an exploration strategy using our proposed framework.}

  abstract = {Lifelong machine learning (LML) has driven the development of extensive web applications, enabling the learning systems deployed on web servers to deal with a sequence of tasks in an incremental fashion. Such systems can retain knowledge from learned tasks in a knowledge base and seamlessly apply it to improve the future learning. Unfortunately, most existing LML methods require labels in every task, whereas providing persistent human labeling for all future tasks is costly, onerous, error-prone, and hence impractical. Motivated by this situation, we propose a new paradigm named unsupervised lifelong learning with curricula (ULLC), where only one task needs to be labeled for initialization and the system then performs lifelong learning for subsequent tasks in an unsupervised fashion. A main challenge of realizing this paradigm lies in the occurrence of negative knowledge transfer, where partial old knowledge becomes detrimental for learning a given task yet cannot be filtered out by the learner without the help of labels. To overcome this challenge, we draw insights from the learning behaviors of humans. Specifically, when faced with a difficult task that cannot be well tackled by our current knowledge, we usually postpone it and work on some easier tasks first, which allows us to grow our knowledge. Thereafter, once we go back to the postponed task, we are more likely to tackle it well as we are more knowledgeable now. The key idea of ULLC is similar \textendash{} at any time, a pool of candidate tasks are organized in a curriculum by their distances to the knowledge base. The learner then starts from the closer tasks, accumulates knowledge from learning them, and moves to learn the faraway tasks with a gradually augmented knowledge base. The viability and effectiveness of our proposal are substantiated through extensive empirical studies on both synthetic and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful tool for a variety of learning tasks, however deep nets typically exhibit forgetting when learning multiple tasks in sequence. To mitigate forgetting, we propose an experience replay process that augments the standard FIFO buffer and selectively stores experiences in a long-term memory. We explore four strategies for selecting which experiences will be stored: favoring surprise, favoring reward, matching the global training distribution, and maximizing coverage of the state space. We show that distribution matching successfully prevents catastrophic forgetting, and is consistently the best approach on all domains tested. While distribution matching has better and more consistent performance, we identify one case in which coverage maximization is beneficial - when tasks that receive less trained are more important. Overall, our results show that selective experience replay, when suitable selection algorithms are employed, can prevent catastrophic forgetting.},

Whereas in a neural network the parameters are typically modelled as scalar values, an individual synapse in the brain comprises a complex network of interacting biochemical components that evolve at different timescales. In this paper, we show that by equipping tabular and deep reinforcement learning agents with a synaptic model that incorporates this biological complexity (Benna \& Fusi, 2016), catastrophic forgetting can be mitigated at multiple timescales. In particular, we find that as well as enabling continual learning across sequential training of two simple tasks, it can also be used to overcome within-task forgetting by reducing the need for an experience replay database.},

  abstract = {Neural network has a critical problem, called catastrophic forgetting, where memories for tasks already learned are easily overwritten with memories for a task additionally learned. This problem interferes with continual learning required for autonomous robots, which learn many tasks incrementally from daily activities. To mitigate the catastrophic forgetting, it is important for especially reservoir computing to clarify which neurons should be fired corresponding to each task, since only readout weights are updated according to the degree of firing of neurons. We therefore propose the way to design reservoir computing such that the firing neurons are clearly distinguished from others according to the task to be performed. As a key design feature, we employ fractal network, which has modularity and scalability, to be reservoir layer. In particular, its modularity is fully utilized by designing input layer. As a result, simulations of control tasks using reinforcement learning show that our design mitigates the catastrophic forgetting even when random actions from reinforcement learning prompt parameters to be overwritten. Furthermore, learning multiple tasks with a single network suggests that knowledge for the other tasks can facilitate to learn a new task, unlike the case using completely different networks.},

In continual learning, also referred to as lifelong learning, there are no explicit task boundaries or curricula. As learning agents have become more powerful, continual learning remains one of the frontiers that has resisted quick progress. To test continual learning capabilities we consider a challenging 3D domain with an implicit sequence of tasks and sparse rewards. We propose a novel agent architecture called Unicorn, which demonstrates strong continual learning and outperforms several baseline agents on the proposed domain. The agent achieves this by jointly representing and learning multiple policies efficiently, using a parallel off-policy learning setup.},

To address this challenge, we introduce the novel problem of lifelong learning from demonstration, which allows the agent to continually build upon knowledge learned from previously demonstrated tasks to accelerate the learning of new tasks, reducing the amount of demonstrations required. As one solution to this problem, we propose the first lifelong learning approach to inverse reinforcement learning, which learns consecutive tasks via demonstration, continually transferring knowledge between tasks to improve performance.}

  abstract = {Humans and animals can learn complex predictive models that allow them to accurately and reliably reason about real-world phenomena, and they can adapt such models extremely quickly in the face of unexpected changes. Deep neural network models allow us to represent very complex functions, but lack this capacity for rapid online adaptation. The goal in this paper is to develop a method for continual online learning from an incoming stream of data, using deep neural network models. We formulate an online learning procedure that uses stochastic gradient descent to update model parameters, and an expectation maximization algorithm with a Chinese restaurant process prior to develop and maintain a mixture of models to handle non-stationary task distributions. This allows for all models to be adapted as necessary, with new models instantiated for task changes and old models recalled when previously seen tasks are encountered again. Furthermore, we observe that meta-learning can be used to meta-train a model such that this direct online adaptation with SGD is effective, which is otherwise not the case for large function approximators. In this work, we apply our meta-learning for online learning (MOLe) approach to model-based reinforcement learning, where adapting the predictive model is critical for control; we demonstrate that MOLe outperforms alternative prior methods, and enables effective continuous adaptation in non-stationary task distributions such as varying terrains, motor failures, and unexpected disturbances.

Interference occurs when updates, to improve performance for some inputs, degrades performance for others. Recent work has shown that sparse representations\textemdash where only a small percentage of units are active\textemdash can significantly reduce interference. Those works, however, relied on relatively complex regularization or meta-learning approaches, that have only been used offline in a pre-training phase. In our approach, we design an activation function that naturally produces sparse representations, and so is much more amenable to online training. The idea relies on the simple approach of binning, but overcomes the two key limitations of binning: zero gradients for the flat regions almost everywhere, and lost precision\textemdash reduced discrimination\textemdash due to coarse aggregation. We introduce a Leaky Tiling Activation (LTA) that provides non-negligible gradients and produces overlap between bins that improves discrimination. We empirically investigate both value-based and policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithms that use neural networks with LTAs, in classic discrete-action control environments and Mujoco continuous-action environments. We show that, with LTAs, learning is faster, with more stable policies, without needing target networks.},

We then propose a new algorithm, Meta-Experience Replay (MER), that directly exploits this view by combining experience replay with optimization based meta-learning. This method learns parameters that make interference based on future gradients less likely and transfer based on future gradients more likely. 1 We conduct experiments across continual lifelong supervised learning benchmarks and non-stationary reinforcement learning environments demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms recently proposed baselines for continual learning. Our experiments show that the gap between the performance of MER and baseline algorithms grows both as the environment gets more non-stationary and as the fraction of the total experiences stored gets smaller.},

In the brain, replay of past experience is widely believed to reduce forgetting, yet it has been largely overlooked as a solution to forgetting in deep reinforcement learning. Here, we introduce CLEAR, a replay-based method that greatly reduces catastrophic forgetting in multi-task reinforcement learning.
