  abstract = {Humans are able to continually learn new information and acquire skills that meet the demands of an ever-changing environment. Yet, this new learning does not necessarily occur at the expense of old memories. The specialised biological mechanisms that permit continual learning in humans and other mammals are not fully understood. Here I explore the possibility that neural inhibition plays an important role. I present recent findings from studies in humans that suggest inhibition regulates the stability of neural networks to gate cortical plasticity and memory retrieval. These studies use non-invasive methods to obtain an indirect measure of neural inhibition and corroborate comparable findings in animals. Together these studies reveal a model whereby neural inhibition protects memories from interference to permit continual learning. Neural inhibition may, therefore, play a critical role in the computations that underlie higher-order cognition and adaptive behaviour.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity is thought to be the basis of learning and memory, but it is mostly studied on the timescale of mere minutes. This review discusses synaptic consolidation, a process that enables synapses to retain their strength for a much longer time (days to years), instead of returning to their original value. The process involves specific plasticity-related proteins, and depends on the dopamine D1/D5 receptors. Here, we review the research on synaptic consolidation, describing electrophysiology experiments, recent modeling work, as well as behavioral correlates.},

  abstract = {Previously encoded memories can be damaged by encoding of new memories, especially when they are relevant to the new data and hence can be disrupted by new training - a phenomenon called "catastrophic forgetting." Human and animal brains are capable of continual learning, allowing them to learn from past experience and to integrate newly acquired information with previously stored memories. A range of empirical data suggest important role of sleep in consolidation of recent memories and protection of the past knowledge from catastrophic forgetting. To explore potential mechanisms of how sleep can enable continual learning in neuronal networks, we developed a biophysically-realistic thalamocortical network model where we could train multiple memories with different degree of interference. We found that in a wake-like state of the model, training of a "new" memory that overlaps with previously stored "old" memory results in degradation of the old memory. Simulating NREM sleep state immediately after new learning led to replay of both old and new memories - this protected old memory from forgetting and ultimately enhanced both memories. The effect of sleep was similar to the interleaved training of the old and new memories. The study revealed that the network slow-wave oscillatory activity during simulated deep sleep leads to a complex reorganization of the synaptic connectivity matrix that maximizes separation between groups of synapses responsible for conflicting memories in the overlapping population of neurons. The study predicts that sleep may play a protective role against catastrophic forgetting and enables brain networks to undergo continual learning.},

  abstract = {Since its publication in 1949, D.O. Hebb's, The Organization of Behavior has been one of the most influential books in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. However, the original edition has been unavailable since 1966, ensuring that Hebb's comment that a classic normally means "cited but not read" is true in his case. This new edition rectifies a long-standing problem for behavioral neuroscientists\textendash the inability to obtain one of the most cited publications in the field. The Organization of Behavior played a significant part in stimulating the investigation of the neural foundations of behavior and continues to be inspiring because it provides a general framework for relating behavior to synaptic organization through the dynamics of neural networks. D.O. Hebb was also the first to examine the mechanisms by which environment and experience can influence brain structure and function, and his ideas formed the basis for work on enriched environments as stimulants for behavioral development. References to Hebb, the Hebbian cell assembly, the Hebb synapse, and the Hebb rule increase each year. These forceful ideas of 1949 are now applied in engineering, robotics, and computer science, as well as neurophysiology, neuroscience, and psychology\textendash a tribute to Hebb's foresight in developing a foundational neuropsychological theory of the organization of behavior.},

  abstract = {Multilayer connectionist models of memory based on the encoder model using the backpropagation learning rule are evaluated. The models are applied to standard recognition memory procedures in which items are studied sequentially and then tested for retention. Sequential learning in these models leads to 2 major problems. First, well-learned information is forgotten rapidly as new information is learned. Second, discrimination between studied items and new items either decreases or is nonmonotonic as a function of learning. To address these problems, manipulations of the network within the multilayer model and several variants of the multilayer model were examined, including a model with prelearned memory and a context model, but none solved the problems. The problems discussed provide limitations on connectionist models applied to human memory and in tasks where information to be learned is not all available during learning.},

In Experiments 1 and 2, more training resulted in higher error rates when new processing sequences that resembled familiar ones were introduced in transfer. Transfer error responses were executed with the same speed as correct responses to familiar sequence trials, and the errors appeared to be undetected by the performers. Experiment 3 tested whether the effects of sequence learning were attributable to explicit or implicit knowledge of processing sequences. Evidence favored the implicit learning interpretation. Findings are discussed in relationship to earlier demonstrations of the einstellung effect and to current taxonomic theories of human error.},
