  abstract = {We introduce a new neural network-based continual learning algorithm, dubbed as Uncertainty-regularized Continual Learning (UCL), which builds on traditional Bayesian online learning framework with variational inference. We focus on two significant drawbacks of the recently proposed regularization-based methods: a) considerable additional memory cost for determining the per-weight regularization strengths and b) the absence of gracefully forgetting scheme, which can prevent performance degradation in learning new tasks. In this paper, we show UCL can solve these two problems by introducing a fresh interpretation on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term of the variational lower bound for Gaussian mean-field approximation. Based on the interpretation, we propose the notion of node-wise uncertainty, which drastically reduces the number of additional parameters for implementing per-weight regularization. Moreover, we devise two additional regularization terms that enforce stability by freezing important parameters for past tasks and allow plasticity by controlling the actively learning parameters for a new task. Through extensive experiments, we show UCL convincingly outperforms most of recent state-of-the-art baselines not only on popular supervised learning benchmarks, but also on challenging lifelong reinforcement learning tasks.

  abstract = {Despite their effectiveness in a wide range of tasks, deep architectures suffer from some important limitations. In particular, they are vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting, i.e. they perform poorly when they are required to update their model as new classes are available but the original training set is not retained. This paper addresses this problem in the context of semantic segmentation. Current strategies fail on this task because they do not consider a peculiar aspect of semantic segmentation: since each training step provides annotation only for a subset of all possible classes, pixels of the background class (i.e. pixels that do not belong to any other classes) exhibit a semantic distribution shift. In this work we revisit classical incremental learning methods, proposing a new distillation-based framework which explicitly accounts for this shift. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy to initialize classifier's parameters, thus preventing biased predictions toward the background class. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an extensive evaluation on the Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, significantly outperforming state of the art incremental learning methods.},

  abstract = {Incremental learning (IL) is an important task aimed at increasing the capability of a trained model, in terms of the number of classes recognizable by the model. The key problem in this task is the requirement of storing data (e.g. images) associated with existing classes, while teaching the classifier to learn new classes. However, this is impractical as it increases the memory requirement at every incre-mental step, which makes it impossible to implement IL algorithms on edge devices with limited memory. Hence, we propose a novel approach, called 'Learning without Memorizing (LwM)', to preserve the information about existing (base) classes, without storing any of their data, while making the classifier progressively learn the new classes. In LwM, we present an information preserving penalty: Attention Distillation Loss (L AD), and demonstrate that penalizing the changes in classifiers' attention maps helps to retain information of the base classes, as new classes are added. We show that adding L AD to the distillation loss which is an existing information preserving loss consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art performance in the iILSVRC-small and iCIFAR-100 datasets in terms of the overall accuracy of base and incrementally learned classes.},

  abstract = {Deep learning approaches are nowadays ubiquitously used to tackle computer vision tasks such as semantic segmentation, requiring large datasets and substantial computational power. Continual learning for semantic segmentation (CSS) is an emerging trend that consists in updating an old model by sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly proposed challenging benchmarks.},

Our setting adds future classes, with no training samples at all. We introduce Ghost Model, a representation-learning-based model for continual learning using ideas from zero-shot learning. A generative model of the representation space in concert with a careful adjustment of the losses allows us to exploit insights from future classes to constraint the spatial arrangement of the past and current classes. Quantitative results on the AwA2 and aP\textbackslash\&Y datasets and detailed visualizations showcase the interest of this new setting and the method we propose to address it.},

PODNet innovates on existing art with an efficient spatial-based distillation-loss applied throughout the model and a representation comprising multiple proxy vectors for each class. We validate those innovations thoroughly, comparing PODNet with three state-of-the-art models on three datasets: CIFAR100, ImageNet100, and ImageNet1000.

  abstract = {Continual learning aims to learn new tasks without forgetting previously learned ones. This is especially challenging when one cannot access data from previous tasks and when the model has a fixed capacity. Current regularization-based continual learning algorithms need an external representation and extra computation to measure the parameters' importance. In contrast, we propose Uncertainty-guided Continual Bayesian Neural Networks (UCB), where the learning rate adapts according to the uncertainty defined in the probability distribution of the weights in networks. Uncertainty is a natural way to identify what to remember and what to change as we continually learn, and thus mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We also show a variant of our model, which uses uncertainty for weight pruning and retains task performance after pruning by saving binary masks per tasks. We evaluate our UCB approach extensively on diverse object classification datasets with short and long sequences of tasks and report superior or on-par performance compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we show that our model does not necessarily need task information at test time, i.e. it does not presume knowledge of which task a sample belongs to.},

We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and fine-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable. A more surprising observation is that Learning without Forgetting may be able to replace fine-tuning with similar old and new task datasets for improved new task performance.},

  abstract = {Continual learning of deep neural networks is a key requirement for scaling them up to more complex applicative scenarios and for achieving real lifelong learning of these architectures. Previous approaches to the problem have considered either the progressive increase in the size of the networks, or have tried to regularize the network behavior to equalize it with respect to previously observed tasks. In the latter case, it is essential to understand what type of information best represents this past behavior. Common techniques include regularizing the past outputs, gradients, or individual weights. In this work, we propose a new, relatively simple and efficient method to perform continual learning by regularizing instead the network internal embeddings. To make the approach scalable, we also propose a dynamic sampling strategy to reduce the memory footprint of the required external storage. We show that our method performs favorably with respect to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature, while requiring significantly less space in memory and computational time. In addition, inspired by to recent works, we evaluate the impact of selecting a more flexible model for the activation functions inside the network, evaluating the impact of catastrophic forgetting on the activation functions themselves.},

We present a method to address this issue, and learn object detectors incrementally, when neither the original training data nor annotations for the original classes in the new training set are available. The core of our proposed solution is a loss function to balance the interplay between predictions on the new classes and a new distillation loss which minimizes the discrepancy between responses for old classes from the original and the updated networks. This incremental learning can be performed multiple times, for a new set of classes in each step, with a moderate drop in performance compared to the baseline network trained on the ensemble of data.
